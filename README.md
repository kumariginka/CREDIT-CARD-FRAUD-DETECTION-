 One of the major concerns for financial institutions is a fraud. As the number of transactions is increasing, it is also increasing the chances of fraud. But now, financial institutions can keep track of scams and frauds in a better way by using the analytical tools to analyze the big data.

Credit card fraud will remain at the top of the list of financial scams. There has been an improvement in the detection of these types of fraud because of the development of algorithms. Anomaly detection is much easier now with higher accuracy. The losses from the scams are promptly minimized by the detection alert received at real-time by the companies about the anomalies in financial purchases.

Unusual patterns in trading data are identified using various machine learning tools. Financial institutions are alerted, and the anomalies are taken for further investigation. There are many other types of fraud also which are detected by understanding the pattern of the data which seems to be suspicious and many insurance companies are using several clustering algorithms to segregate the data and understand the cluster pattern of information
